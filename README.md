# Detour - Flutter Turism App

Project created during an Hackathon, at FCT-UNL (2019), where I was the lead developer of this app, while my team worked on design, research and functionality. Detour is a targeted to those who look for interesting spots or small trips nearby but outside big citys. It's purpose was to satisfy the need of spreading awareness for the smaller points of interest in our country, which only a few people usually enjoy and know of.
